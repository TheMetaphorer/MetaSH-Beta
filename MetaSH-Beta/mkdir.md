# mkdir #

The mkdir command makes directories. Simple enough, right? Here's how to use it.

`mkdir [location]`

This command will make directories to a specified path. If you are in a directory, you do not need to put the preceding directory if you want to make a sub-directory of that directory. For example, if you are in /home/Peter/, and you want to make a folder in that directory called test, then you do not need to specify that you are in /home/peter.

The mkdir command also supports multiple commands at once.
